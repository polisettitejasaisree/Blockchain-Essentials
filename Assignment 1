1.Blockchain is a technology which is used to secure our data.
Here no of blocks are created and join together with a signature.
It is a combination of distributed database and cryptography.
2. Blockchain is used to solve authenticity, security and presence of 3rd party problems.
3.Features of the blockchain:
a) verifiable
b) unchangeable
c) Tamper-proof
d) immutable
4.A single block contain data like 1)Block number 2.)Transaction record 3)Previous block signature
5.The verifiability of Blockchain is attained by previous block signature.
Each signature can be obtained with the help of cryptography.If a block created ,a signature also cretes along with it.
When the data changes in the block automatically the signature also changes.
So when a block signature doesn't matches with next block(present as prev signature) then it is said that data is changed.
